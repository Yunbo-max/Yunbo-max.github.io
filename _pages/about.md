Long Yunbo is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge, focusing on the generation of tabular and graph data. His research encompasses both scaling up and compression of data. Specifically, he investigates the synthesis of heterogeneous and time-series data using autoencoders and deep diffusion generative models to create new datasets. Additionally, his work includes data distillation in hyperbolic space to reduce redundancy in large-scale datasets, optimizing data for specific machine learning tasks.
