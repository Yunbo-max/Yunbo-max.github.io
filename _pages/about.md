I am a  PhD Student at [University of Cambrdige](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/astrophysics/i-kit-matthew-cheng-phd-student). My research focuses on the development of risk quantification algorithms in heterogeneous graph neural networks. By applying decentralisation, privacy preservation and distributed learning, the approach can be applied to supply chain finance and risk management based on supply chain relationship networks and financial reporting data.

This research further advances the application of trusted AI in supply chain finance (e.g., anti-fraud, anomaly detection, traceability, etc.).
