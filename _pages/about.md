Yunbo is a PhD student in the Supply Chain AI Lab under the supervision of Prof. Alexandra Brintrup. Based on the lab's research in knowledge graph extraction and uncertainty representation, his research focuses on synthetic data generation and anomaly detection in graph networks.The research involves the application of methods such as Bayesian classifiers, autoencoders, and deep diffusion generative models, autoencoders, and deep diffusion generative models to create synthetic tables and graph data.

Using the generated synthetic data, Yunbo studied fraud detection and identification in supply chain transaction networks.
Fraud Detection and Recognition in Transaction Networks. This research marks an important step in the application of trusted AI in supply chain finance, including anti-fraud measures, and credit assessment. Prior to pursuing his PhD, Yunbo received an undergraduate first class honors degree from the University of Birmingham.
